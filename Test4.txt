Question 4:
If you use the same PreAuthorize configuration on each method in a class, how can you
make the annotations cleaner?

Answer: 
Let's say we are having @PreAuthorized("SOME_KEY") on each method.
To make the annotations cleaner, we can add @PreAuthorized("SOME_KEY") at the class annotations.
